No consistent auth, rate limiting, or documentation.\n\n## What We Built\n\n- **API catalog** — auto-imported from OpenAPI specs in each repo's CI pipeline\n- **Interactive playground** — test any endpoint with real auth tokens, see request/response\n- **SDK generator** — auto-generated TypeScript and Python clients from OpenAPI specs\n- **Gateway layer** — unified auth (JWT), rate limiting, request logging, and circuit breaking\n\n## Developer Experience\n\n```\n1.
